1. Do you have 3+ years of non-internship professional software development experience? (not including internships, part time jobs, co-ops, professor teaching) If yes, share your years of total SDE work experience –
Yes, I have over 5 years of non-internship professional software development experience.

a. Can you provide an overview of your current/past role?
Currently, I serve as Lead Engineer at Bloomers.ng, a healthtech platform, where I lead both frontend and backend engineering efforts, oversee system design, and mentor engineers.
Previously at Dot, I led the development of a retail health insurance platform. At Nomba (formerly Kudi), I contributed to critical financial systems in a fast-paced fintech environment. Across these roles, I’ve worked extensively with modern technologies including NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Kubernetes.

b. Tell me about some of your daily activities in your current role?
On a daily basis, I:
	•	Write and review TypeScript (NestJS, React) code
	•	Conduct design and architecture reviews
	•	Lead planning and grooming sessions
	•	Collaborate cross-functionally with product and design teams
	•	Mentor junior engineers
	•	Monitor performance and improve system reliability

Coding

2. What is your preferred coding language?
TypeScript

a. What is the percentage of time that you spend coding day to day?
Approximately 70–80%

b. Do you prefer frontend, backend, or full stack roles?
I prefer full stack roles, with a strong inclination toward backend and system design.

3. Can you tell me about your experience leading code/design reviews?
Yes, I’ve led and facilitated code and design reviews across multiple teams. At Bloomers, I implemented a structured review process for all production-bound code. At Dot and Nomba, I reviewed over 200+ PRs across microservices, ensuring adherence to coding standards and design best practices. I also mentored junior engineers on test coverage and architectural decisions, improving team output and reducing post-release defects.

System Design

4. Do you have 2+ years of non-internship design or architecture experience including design patterns, reliability, and scaling of new and existing systems? If Yes, share your total years of design experience –
Yes, I have over 3 years of hands-on design and architecture experience.

5. When it comes to high level architectural design, what part of the system architecture are you currently responsible for building? (I.e. new features/components or core architecture)
I am responsible for both core architecture and new feature design across systems. At Nomba, I led architectural efforts on critical financial services including transaction processing, issue resolution, and accounting exports. I owned the design and maintenance of over five microservices, built with Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch, and deployed via Kubernetes on GCP.

Additionally, I independently designed and built a Forex trading platform as a side project, where I implemented wallet services, transaction matching logic, and retry-safe order handling using RabbitMQ. The architecture included service-to-service authentication, NestJS microservices, and PostgreSQL, and handled complex flows like order books, rate integration, and balance management. This project sharpened my expertise in financial systems and high-volume, resilient service design.

At Bloomers, I led the company-wide transition from C# to NestJS, implemented a multi-tenant appointment scheduling system using Node.js and Prisma, and optimized cloud infrastructure to reduce costs by 90%. At Growsurf, I architected backend microservices for asynchronous CSV export pipelines and designed Redis-based algorithms for high-volume email delivery.

a. What percentage of time do you spend on design or architecture day to day?
Roughly 30–40%

b. Approximately how many users or transactions does the system support?
Systems I’ve worked on support tens of thousands of users and hundreds of thousands of transactions monthly, with significant peak traffic during operational hours.

c. How much of this project did you lead/drive yourself?
I led or co-led the majority of core projects. At Bloomers, I spearheaded the cloud migration, design of the scheduling system, and cost optimization efforts. At Dot, I led backend design for a real-time transaction export pipeline and NestJS microservices. At Nomba, I owned multiple microservices, managed code quality, and drove architectural decisions for backend performance improvements.
